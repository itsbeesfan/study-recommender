## STUDY RECOMMENDER
This program aims to show the best resources (YouTube videos, Research Papers and eBooks) for the topic you assign it to. 
It uses the _**YouTube v3 API**_, _**Google Books API**_ and _**Semantic Scholar**_ to get the best resources for the most useful study session!!!!!!!

It really is very useful to have a lot of resources in the same page. 

## FEATURES
Might add some more features later, like specific YouTube channels for the topic/subject, but for now, we have papers
and YouTube videos.

Please refresh the page when changing your research topic/class/query.
## THANKS AND GETTING STARTED
Work in progress (maybe, if people like this enough I might add more features like the YouTube channels or web pages with
topic information.) **Suggestions and feedback are always happily accepted!**

Thanks to my big brother for the motivation, to frigo l. for his support and for leaving me on delivered (really fueled 
me to finish >:c) to HackClub for the inspiration to start coding and working towards my 
goals and to Beyoncé for my life.
